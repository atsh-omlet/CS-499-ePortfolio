# CS 499 Professional Self-Assessment

Over the course of the Computer Science Program, I have learned a lot and have grown from writing small, isolated scripts for assignments to developing fully structured and functional applications. This ePortfolio demonstrates my problem-solving ability and commitment to improvement and represents the culmination of my journey at SNHU.

## Collaborating in a Team Environment

In CS 250, I learned about the Software Design Life Cycle and the difference between traditional Waterfall models and Scrum-Agile models. This course taught me about the various phases of the Agile SDLC as well as the various roles involved, including the Product Owner,  Scrum-master,  Developer, and Tester. 
Working through this course helped me gain an understanding of what each role is responsible for in each phase and how, together, they contribute to the success of a collaborative project.

## Communicating with Stakeholders

This program has taught me a lot about how communication should be facilitated with stakeholders. In CS 255 System Analysis and Design, for example, I learned how to identify functional and non-functional system requirements, analyze use cases and activity flows, and identify system limitations. Completing this program has made me aware of the importance of the ability of being able to communicate this information to an audience using non-technical terms. 

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in the field of Computer Science. Throughout various courses, I have learned how to apply and implement these concepts in various projects. In my capstone project, for example, I successfully used what I learned to develop a dynamic search algorithm for filtering events, demonstrating algorithmic thinking. 

## Software Engineering and Database

In CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming, I learned how to design and build an Android application from the ground up. By accomplishing this, I have gained valuable experience building functional software, which I would enhance in the capstone. In this course, I also became familiar with design patterns such as MVC and MVVM. In CS 340 Client Server Development, I learned about the difference between traditional relational databases and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, and gained hands-on experience with NoSQL by developing a dashboard using Dash and Python.

## Security

In CS 305 Software Security, I learned about secure coding practices, input validation, authentication, and the importance of anticipating vulnerabilities early in the design process. I also learned to use tools such as dependency checks to identify vulnerabilities and how to resolve them. This helped me develop a security-focused mindset while designing software.

## Summary of Artifacts

In my final CS 499 Capstone Project, all the skills I learned throughout the program were put to use in the enhancement of my Event Tracker application that was originally developed for CS 360.
The project demonstrates:

- **Software Design and Engineering**: Refactoring to an MVVM architecture to enforce separation of concerns and adding hashing to improve security.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Implementing a dynamic search system
- **Databases**: Migrating from SQLite to MongoDB Realm to adopt a modern, object-based data model.

The enhancements made in the Capstone Project build upon knowledge and skills from multiple courses and showcase my ability to integrate software design, algorithmic reasoning, database management, and secure coding into a single cohesive project. Completing this program has given me more confidence in my technical abilities and potential to succeed as a developer.
